            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Beautiful Speedometer for Bikes</h1><p>Shout-out to designers who are also obsessed with cycling because their work frequently results in something new and clever, like the arresting Omata One. Mounted onto a bike, the speedometer's unique analog face informs of the four most relevant ride metrics (speed, distance, ascent and time).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d105236023603a813c26d257fbe058ad72b3f663.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bits And Pieces - An organic wave of Hoberman Spheres</h1><p>Currently on show at Berlin's NOME Gallery is the latest work by Nils VÃ¶lker titled Bits And Pieces. The installation consists out of 108 mass-produced toy spheres hanging in the middle of the exhibition space, individually addressable and controlled, to create organic waves that appear to move throughout the space.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/29c17de1db318a16ae7c090ab6a2dab8f308c76c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
